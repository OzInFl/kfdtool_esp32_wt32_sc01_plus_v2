# KFDtool-ESP32 Standalone Keyloader (WT32-SC01-PLUS)

This is a **PlatformIO** project that gives you a starting point for a **standalone keyloader** inspired by the open-source [KFDtool](https://github.com/KFDtool/KFDtool) project, but running entirely on an **ESP32-S3 WT32-SC01-PLUS** with a touch LCD.
