#include "key_container.h"

// Stub implementation: all methods of KeyContainerManager are currently
// defined inline in key_container.h so there is nothing to do here.
//
// This file is kept intentionally minimal so that PlatformIO continues
// to see a src/key_container.cpp translation unit, but without pulling
// in the older mbedTLS-heavy implementation while we stabilise the UI
// and persistence layer.
